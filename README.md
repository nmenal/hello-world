Hello! 

Here I am, this is me. There's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be. 
Here I am, it's just me and you. Tonight we make our dreams come true. 
It's a new world, it's a new start. It's alive with the beating of young hearts. 
It's a new day, it's a new plan. I've been waiting for you. 
Here I am. Here I am. Here we are, we've just begun.
